# SMS Spam Detection (NLP Project)

A simple **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** project for detecting spam messages using both **classical ML techniques (TF-IDF + Naive Bayes/Logistic Regression)** and **modern Transformer embeddings (DistilBERT)**.

This project is designed to learn and implement core NLP terminologies and techniques like **text preprocessing, tokenization, stopword removal, Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF, embeddings, and classification.**

---

## **Project Overview**
- **Goal:** Classify SMS messages as `spam` or `ham` (not spam).
- **Dataset:** [SMS Spam Collection (UCI ML Repository)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00228/smsspamcollection.zip)
- **Approach:**
  - Data cleaning (lowercasing, punctuation removal, etc.).
  - Tokenization and stopword removal using **NLTK**.
  - Feature extraction via **BoW** and **TF-IDF**.
  - Model training using **Multinomial Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression**.
  - Advanced embeddings using **DistilBERT** with Logistic Regression.
  - Evaluation with metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, `transformers`, `torch`
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, GitHub
